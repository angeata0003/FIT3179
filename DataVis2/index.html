            <h2>Total Medals Worldwide</h2>
            <p>Over the course of 120 years the world has changed in many ways, but one piece of consistency in all this time has been 
              the existence of the Olympic games. 
            </p>
            <p>From 1896 through to 2016, some countries have amassed significnatly more medals than others, for example, the USA which has 5219 over the 120 years. 
              Many of the darker countries (that is those
              that have won more medals over 120 years) are consistently in more economically developed countries such as Western Europe and Australia.
              By comparison some countries such as Bolivia have not won a single medal. 
              This is likely attributed to the lower socioeconomic 
              status of worse performing countries. Countries suffering from greater economic disparity have fewer equipment, training facilities, 
              coaches and resources which prevents them from supporting their athletes as much as other countries. 
              In modern times, athletes from more economically developed countries receive sponsorships to compete whereas athletes from 
              poorer countries have to pay for themselves which can prevent athletes from competeting and consequently placing on the podium.

              <h2>Medals in Summer and Winter</h2>
              <p>Europe has far more well
                performing athletes and in most Olympic Games amasses far more medals collectively 
                than North America which has fewer strongly performing countries (namely Canada and the USA). </p>
                <p>Further, South American and African countries have not competed
                in the winter Olympics. South America does not experience the kind of snow fall that would allow athletes to train without signfincant cost. 
                Athletes would have to travel to countries that have snowfall and many athletes would simply not be able to afford that. 
              </p>
              <p>
                There is a noticeable dip in the 1920s for the summer Olympics. This could be due to the Great Depression that left 
                many people without work and money (meaning that compteting in the Olympics was no longer a priority). Additionally, 
                the first winter Olympics were in 1924, as seen by the scale of the x-axis on the right chart. Prior to this 
                the games were not separated into summer and winter.

            <h2>Height and Weight of Athletes</h2>
        <p>The chart on the left depicts the correlation between the weights and heights of men and women in the games. 
          The blue lines show the mean weight (at 70.7kg) and height (at 175.33m) of all athletes that have ever competed.
      </p>
      <p>These annotations help make comparisons between certain sports to the means of all time to see how different sports have different requirements for height and weight. 
        For example, when selecting Rhythmic Gymnastics with the seleciton bar, it becomes obvious that 
        the average Rhythmic Gymnast is shorter and lighter than the average Olympian. This is partially because they are all women but also likley because being small and light
        makes completing the floor moves easier. In contrast, the average basketballer is significatly taller  than the average Olympian. 
      </p>
      <p>The chart further highlights the differences between the sexes. One such example is boxing wherein there are far more males than females. 
      </p>
      <p>When compared to all athletes, weightlifters 
        have a similar height distribution but are on average heavier for that height (that is the gradient of the points is steeper). This makes sense
        given that weightlifters would have proportional more muscle.

            <h2>Athletes</h2>
            <p>The chart on the far left highlights the Olympains which have won the most medals of all time. Evidently, the swimmer Michael Phelps has set a difficult 
              record to beat. This record could however be aided by the fact that the swimming has a very high number of events in which an individual 
              could earn a medal. 
            </p>

            <p>When looking at the x-axis of the age distribution chart, 
              it becomes obvious that there have been far fewer female medalists than male medalists by a factor of between two and three. Blatant sexism in the 
            early 20th century meant that females could compete in far fewer sports. Despite the fact that in the modern Olympics there is an approximate 
            50-50 split between male and female athletes, even in 1988 only 25% of athletes were female. As such, predictably, far fewer females have won medals 
            since there has been signfincantly fewer females competing over the 120 years. This could also explain why there are fewer females in the right most chart. 
            Interestingly, female athletes have more medalists in the 15-19 category however for 
            both sexes the majority of medalists are in their early 20s wherein physical maturation such as muscle strength, reaction time and heart functionioning peaks.
